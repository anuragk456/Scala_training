In the function  create three  threads where each thread has a logic to generate a random number. first thread name is firstThread. second thread name is secondThread. third thread name is thirdThread.all three threads runs infinetly. whenever any of the thread gets 1567 as the random number.it should resolve the promise by using success with. the message threadname+ \" has generated \" + 1567.it should stop and it should also notify (find a mechanism). other threads to stop.the main thread should wait for the future to be. complete and print the message."
